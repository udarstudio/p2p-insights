          P2P investing skips the banks and lets investors fund real
          people and businesses directly. You earn interest as borrowers
          repay, and platforms handle the screening, servicing, and payments.
          It is simple in concept: you supply capital, they put it to work.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-300 sm:text-lg">
          P2P can be a smart middle ground
          between low yield savings and high volatility stocks, offering
          higher yields than savings accounts or CDs, but only if you
          treat it like a portfolio, not a lottery ticket. Diversification
          credit quality and platform fees matter.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-300 sm:text-lg">
          The upside is steady cash flow and transparent loan terms. The
          downside is real: defaults happen and liquidity can be limited. If
          you want returns that feel earned instead of hoped for, P2P investing
          is worth a serious look.
